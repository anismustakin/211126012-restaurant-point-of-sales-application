# Online Restaurant Order Application #
This application is for a online restaurant. Meaning that there is no physical restaurant where individuals will come and sit to eat, but rather order whatever food they desire online and it will be delivered to their doorstep. What makes this different from a delivery system such as Mr. Delivery is that it does not take orders from multiple restaurants. The owner still has a venue where the food is prepared and then delivered.
